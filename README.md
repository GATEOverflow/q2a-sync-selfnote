# Q2A Sync Plugin

## Overview
The **Sync Plugin** extends Question2Answer (Q2A) by allowing users to link related questions across the site (or even across a network of Q2A sites).  
It also introduces a **User Notes** feature that lets each user privately store personal notes on any question.

This plugin is designed to improve collaboration, content organization, and personal tracking of question relationships.
